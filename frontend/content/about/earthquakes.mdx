## Overview

An **earthquake** is a sudden shaking of the ground caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth’s surface. This movement releases energy in the form of seismic waves, which can damage buildings, roads, bridges, and utilities.

Earthquakes are among the most **unpredictable natural disasters**, often striking without warning. While they usually last only seconds, their impacts can be devastating—especially in densely populated areas.

### Causes
- Sudden movement along geological faults  
- Shifting of tectonic plates  
- Volcanic activity  
- Human activities such as mining or large reservoirs  

### Warning Signs
Earthquakes usually **cannot be predicted**, but some possible indicators include:
- Small tremors (foreshocks)
- Unusual animal behavior
- Sudden changes in groundwater levels  

> ⚠️ Always rely on **official seismic alerts**, not rumors or myths.

## Preparedness

### Before an Earthquake
- Secure heavy furniture and appliances to walls  
- Identify safe spots in each room (under sturdy tables)  
- Prepare an emergency kit for your household

### During an Earthquake
- **Drop, Cover, and Hold On**
- Stay indoors and away from windows  
- If outside, move to an open area away from buildings and power lines  
- Do **not** use elevators  

### After an Earthquake
- Check yourself and others for injuries  
- Inspect gas, water, and electrical lines  
- Expect aftershocks and stay alert  
- Follow instructions from local authorities
